                        In the mid-90s, when I started to show interest about computers,
                        the name IBM was among the first I learned. It was everywhere,
                        it was important, it was a legend. Today I'm part of this legend.

                            actual payment flow, managed subscriptions and renewals and

                            As an infrastructure engineer I was developing backend
                            solutions using Python and Scala and managing Amazon IaaS
                            Cloud architecture. Our goal was to transition Prezi backend
                            from monolithic hosted application to a microservice
                            architecture in the cloud. The largest project I worked on
                            here was separating the presentation backend/database and
                            moving it to Amazon EC2/RDS instances. I was also part of
                            the authentication service separation and several smaller
                            projects.

                            which became one of the largest weather portals in Hungary since
                            then. Developing this site required such skills as
                            creating web crawlers and various visualizations, and continously
                            maintaining the code to handle the increasing traffic. The
                            extensive use of caching and optimized database usage took key
                            roles in the achievement of reaching 400k+ unique visitors in
                            early 2012.

                        I began my academic studies at BME, but I didn't
                        finish them here. However, this was the place where
                        I started discovering my skills in programming, and it had
                        a huge influence on my professional career.

                            During this time I learned the basics of programming, and
                            wrote my first real applications in C and Java. I acquired
                            some PHP skills for a community project, which I applied
                            for summer work. I quit this institute, when real world
                            project proved to be more interesting and rewarding and
                            I also a realized that there is nothing for me in hardware
                            engineering.

                            It started with an idea to write a simple automated web crawler,
                            that finds Hungarian movie premiere dates and generates a
                            calendar link. Once the robot was working, it was just a step
                            further to get some poster images, plot summary and genres.

                            Today it's a standalone web application with a couple hundred
                            visitors every day. I'm in contact with almost every local
                            distributor, who provide me press materials, and I do weekly
                            social media updates on the actual releases.
