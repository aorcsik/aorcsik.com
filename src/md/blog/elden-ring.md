#### Day 1

Sir Okaheart is a man with aging feaures and signs of silver in his hair. His past of service left him with scars in the flesh and the soul as well. Armored with a sword and shield, he answered the call of grace and now searching for the Elden Ring.

Emerging from the Cave of Knowledge I took the "First Steps": I met with Melina, found the chapel, and bought a few things: a crafting kit, torch, and telescope. Then... I had my ass kicked by a Tree Sentinel, so I decided to go gathering stuff and killing soldiers in the woods. Nice and easy.

#### Day 2

I left the forest north and found the Stormfoot Catacombs at the bottom of the cliffs. In there, I fought some imps, and after escaping a fiery trap, I managed to open the door to the boss—a strange cat-like watchdog. Needed a couple of tries but I figured its pattern and defeted it. First Boss Kill! Looted Wandering Nobles and Noble Sorcerer Ashes... which I had no clue what to do with.

Then I went for the Gatefront Ruins, killed the Soldiers, but the Knight was too hard. All of them bore the same crest and serve Godrick. Who is he? Some king of this region?

Rested east and where Milena told me she finally started believing in me, something her spectral steed Torrent did, from the start. She gave me her Spectral Steed Whistle, so now I could call Torrent any time... where possible.

I ventured further east, avoiding the guys with large swords on horseback and jumped down to the ravine leading north-east from Agheel Lake... just to be invaded and killed by some Bloody Finger guy. Tracked back and found the Murkwood Catacombs with more imps and a Duelist boss… he was too fast and too strong. Death in every corner. I called it a day.

#### Day 3

Went back to the chapel, where a witch called Renna was waiting for me... didn't understand half of what she was saying, but her hat was awesome. She also gave me a Spirit Calling Bell. Now I could use the ashes from the catacombs. With my team of nobles I could beat the knight at the ruins and found a bunch of things there: Lordsworn's Greatsword, Flail, Gilded Greatshield, Whetstone Knife and the map of the region. The Greatsword was the first item on my berserker build list.

I also went back to the Catacombs and with a few lucky parries managed to kill the Grave Warden Duelist too. Got Banished Knight Engvall Ashes.

Feeling powerful I fought my way to Stormveil Castle. On the way I met a sad maiden who gave we jellyfish ashes. She was talking about becoming one with her soldiers who had their limbs and head taken... and given to the Spider... suuuure, so I reached the gates to face Margit. I died, I died running, I died with a cooperator, I died with may nobles... many many ways. I called it a day.

#### Day 4

Left the Castle for more adventures, spent some quality time at the Gateway Ruins and travelled east along the road.

#### Day 5

Saw a strange big plant and giant crabs. Kept going east, killed a pack of wolves and found a bunch of runes in a graveyard of sorts.

When resting, Melina approached me and took meg to Roundtable Hold. After that killed a bunch of broken nobles at the ruins. Below after killing rats I found a chest… one that teleported me into some mine. Surrounded by scarlet rot. Managed to get to a site of grace and escaped.

I had two stone keys so decided to unlock the path near the first steps. After a bunch of tries I escaped the chariot of death and reached the bottom. I have come here eventually to find a Talisman, but I totally forgot where to look so I attempted the tree root monster… and ended up dying a lot and leaving the place.

Went back to the road leading to the Castle and headed east. Met a weapon artist killed more soldiers and found a crypt with skeletons. After a few tries and running back and forth at opened the door to face some assassin. He wasn’t too hard, and now I have a talisman.

#### Day 6

I got back to the Fringe with the killer chariot, jumped down the ledge and managed to dodge the scions and grab the Erdtree's Favor talisman. Done.
Another loose end was the Murkwater Cave where I missed the "boss" Patches. Decided not to kill him when he surrendered, so now he is a merchant there. Done.

And just outside the cave, Bloody Fucking Invading Finger Nerijus. After a few tries managed to run around long enough to the Hunter to join the fight. Killed him too. Done.

I was really into checking off stuff on my list, so... Margit. Why not? I already gained some levels and had my rotting spirit dog. Summoned the sorcerer and jumped right in. He went down. On the first try. OMG! "I shall remember thee, Tarnished!"

Why not push forward. Entered the castle through the side opening after killing the servant with the attitude, I have yet to bring his Bell Bearing to the Twin Maiden Husks in Roundtable Hold. Reading a little about it I've probably made the right decision to kill this bastard early on. He steals runes on death and would have locked me in the room with that damn Knight.

So I went all the way up the side of the castle, killed everyone, gathered everything I saw. I probably cheesed the knight in the Rusty Key room. He stuck heind the door, so I could chip away his health from outside. Still took me quite some time to reach the top. The knight at the top gave me a really hard time.

On the way I found some claws, which I really like. They are fast and build up blood loss, very cool. From the top I parkoured the roofs and somehow managed to get to the next Grace with all my runes. Then the next and finally the one just outside Godrick. This was the perfect point to call this a day.

#### Day 7

I'm not ready for Godrick. That's for sure. So I have to get stronger. Started to venture out from the Graces, and found some nice rune farming areas, but there are a couple of very hard mobs... really frustrating to spend 30 mins getting the runes back and dying right after. I have to keep my distance for now.

There erre two elevators that I could use when I was acscending the castle. I decided to find a way to turn them on. One could be reached from jumping down the north wall along the cliffs. Well falling into a bush really. For the other I had to get past one of the Scions.

On the way I found a quest item for Roderika, the girl outside the castle, who gave me the jellyfish ashes. She got her spirits back and decided to move to Roundtable Hold, where after some discussion with the blacksmith, she set up her spirit tuner shop.

I figured out that I can hold my Hookclaws in both hands, becoming a meetgrinder. Finally managed to kill the big guy outside the elevator room. Actually several times, and one point he dropped his Omen Cleaver, my first great sword, baby.

Upgraded my claws and some other armamanents and even my rotten dog spirit friend, and then, I saw the Tree Sentinel... jumped on Torrent, called the dog and gave him hell with the Omen Cleaver. It took some 10ish tries, gave enough time for crimson rot to kick in, then I just had to keep my distance. A fine closing of the day.

#### Day 8

Felled a Tree Sentinel, I’m powerful… well not yet. I can't use Torrent with Godrick, so pulling this off again is out of the question. I decided to explore Eastern Limgrave, from the south now. Cleared Fort Haight and strolled north, where I heard some wolf howling around some ruins, but only found a bear… a huge one. I already sew these big guys after the chest in Patches cave teleported me to this part. So, while I managed to kill one I was running around avoiding them and finally found the map of this region.

Followed the road around some huge tree and found a round building with a magic elevator that toon me down to Siofra River, deep underground, where the glowing crystals in the ceiling are like a beautiful night sky.

Enemies are tough here so I was mostly strolling around with Torrent gathering stuff. Found some interesting materials and the map of this area too.
I was actually heading north in Limgrave East to get to the point D showed me in Roundtable Hold. So I continued my way and found Kenneth Haight, the wannabe ruler of this land. He asked me to clear his fort, and I told him I did already so he gave me a fancy dagger and asked me pledge allegiance and to visit him, to be knighted.

Moving on I found the ruins of the Church of Marika, and was rewarded with the flask of mixed physiks. This will come in handy.

I found the waygate and met the Beast Clergyman… well he is something, eating deathroots, but he gave me some useful stuff in exchange. Job done, lets get back to Limgrave and meet Kenneth in his Fort…

Well, communicating with demi-humans, sure… didn't work out too well for him. The fort was overrun. Clearing it and meeting the lord rewarded me with only a sad story. Well, not becoming a knight, just yet.

From here I ventured south to the Weeping Penninsula. Beyond the bridge I found Irina, a visually impaired girl waiting for his father, the warden on Castle Morne. She asked me to deliver a letter to her father.

Castle Morne was full of rotten strays and misbegotten. Advancing up I took a turn and ended up behind the castle, followed the path and reached the shore with a boss arena. It took a few tries, but dual wielding the enhanced hookclawas with my scarlet rot puppy, and(!) setting the focus on the boss helped a lot. Leonine Misbegotten felled, the Grafted Blade Greatsword looted and… Edgar is now on revenge for his daughter. The poor girl was murdered while I was delivering her letter.

Now I was feeling powerful, so gave Godrick a try. Went quite well, phase 2 in a few seconds. Let’s start with him tomorrow.

#### Day 9

I went straight to Godrick and gave him hell. It was epic, just a little left from his health, he grabbed me with his dragon arm, smashed me to the ground, flames everywhere, almost dying, when scarlet rot gave him the final blow.

[video]

Got his depleted great rune. I knew where I have to take it. The only problem was that I didn't know the way. Also Kenneth is nowhere to be seen in the throne room. Why he is not around is a mystery for now. Through the throne room I found a way to the region north. But for now my goal is the divine tower.

Took some time to find the way around the ballistas, but I finally reached the beginning of the great bridge. On the way I found the Claw Talisman and opened the main gate. Fought my way through an army of soldiers just to find the entrance guarded by a lion with a blade and attached to its right leg... I don't have time for this, just ran past and discovered the grace beyond the gate. Still I felt obliged to kill the beast, so I went back before I continued my journey to the tower.

At the top of the bridge there were three colossals. Two with axes and one with bow and arrows... huge arrows. I managed to kill one before at Castle Morne, but three, all aggroing the moment I step on the bridge. No way. I somehow managed to get past them and used the waygate that took me to the divine tower. There I could restore the great rune. 

[video]

Back in the Roundtable Hold I enterd the inner chamber, where Enia told me the message of the two fingers… they are fingers, huge fingers.

#### Day 10

I had some leftover business at Castle Morne, so I went back and killed all the Misbegotten on the huge burning pile of... whatever. Beyond that was the armory, where I got the Claymore. This was the last piece of equipment required for the Berserker Build, that gave me some guidance in the first few days. Since then I grew fond of the Hookclaws and my Rotten Puppy... I'll call him Roppy. Plus, I have the Erdtree's Favor and Twinblade talismans equiped. I have to get close with claws in both hand and land a chain attack. With luck this builds up blood loss and also trigger the Twinblade. Worked perfectly on the Leonine Misbegotten two days ago.

There was still a lot to discover on the Weeping Peninsula so I tracked back, and found the Impaler's catacomb. Opening the boss arena was fun. Imps are causing me less problems, but I need the shield here. These annoyingly agile little pests build up blood loss. To my luck the boss here was another Watchdog, similar to the first larger enemy I killed, and four imps all attacking at the same time. Took me and Roppy a few rounds to kill them, before I could focus on the boss. Dodging his moves and punishing with blood loss combos. Wasn't easy, but it worked. Left the place with Demi-human Ashes and some Grave Glovewort, just what I needed to upgrade Roppy at Roderika.
