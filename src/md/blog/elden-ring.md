## Sir Oakheart

### Adventures in Elden Ring

[aorcsik | 2024-07-08 | elden-ring](#meta)

#### Day 1

Sir Okaheart is a man with aging feaures and signs of silver in his hair. His past of service left him with scars in the flesh and the soul as well. Armored with a sword and shield, he answered the call of grace and now searching for the Elden Ring.

Emerging from the Cave of Knowledge I took the "First Steps": I met with Melina, found the chapel, and bought a few things: a crafting kit, torch, and telescope. Then... I had my ass kicked by a Tree Sentinel, so I decided to go gathering stuff and killing soldiers in the woods. Nice and easy.

#### Day 2

I left the forest north and found the Stormfoot Catacombs at the bottom of the cliffs. In there, I fought some imps, and after escaping a fiery trap, I managed to open the door to the boss—a strange cat-like watchdog. Needed a couple of tries but I figured its pattern and defeted it. First Boss Kill! Looted Wandering Nobles and Noble Sorcerer Ashes... which I had no clue what to do with.

Then I went for the Gatefront Ruins, killed the Soldiers, but the Knight was too hard. All of them bore the same crest and serve Godrick. Who is he? Some king of this region?

Rested east and where Milena told me she finally started believing in me, something her spectral steed Torrent did, from the start. She gave me her Spectral Steed Whistle, so now I could call Torrent any time... where possible.

I ventured further east, avoiding the guys with large swords on horseback and jumped down to the ravine leading north-east from Agheel Lake... just to be invaded and killed by some Bloody Finger guy. Tracked back and found the Murkwood Catacombs with more imps and a Duelist boss… he was too fast and too strong. Death in every corner. I called it a day.

#### Day 3

Went back to the chapel, where a witch called Renna was waiting for me... didn't understand half of what she was saying, but her hat was awesome. She also gave me a Spirit Calling Bell. Now I could use the ashes from the catacombs. With my team of nobles I could beat the knight at the ruins and found a bunch of things there: Lordsworn's Greatsword, Flail, Gilded Greatshield, Whetstone Knife and the map of the region. The Greatsword was the first item on my berserker build list.

I also went back to the Catacombs and with a few lucky parries managed to kill the Grave Warden Duelist too. Got Banished Knight Engvall Ashes.

Feeling powerful I fought my way to Stormveil Castle. On the way I met a sad maiden who gave we jellyfish ashes. She was talking about becoming one with her soldiers who had their limbs and head taken... and given to the Spider... suuuure, so I reached the gates to face Margit. I died, I died running, I died with a cooperator, I died with may nobles... many many ways. I called it a day.

#### Day 4

Left the Castle for more adventures, spent some quality time at the Gateway Ruins and travelled east along the road.

#### Day 5

Saw a strange big plant and giant crabs. Kept going east, killed a pack of wolves and found a bunch of runes in a graveyard of sorts.

When resting, Melina approached me and took meg to Roundtable Hold. After that killed a bunch of broken nobles at the ruins. Below after killing rats I found a chest… one that teleported me into some mine. Surrounded by scarlet rot. Managed to get to a site of grace and escaped.

I had two stone keys so decided to unlock the path near the first steps. After a bunch of tries I escaped the chariot of death and reached the bottom. I have come here eventually to find a Talisman, but I totally forgot where to look so I attempted the tree root monster… and ended up dying a lot and leaving the place.

Went back to the road leading to the Castle and headed east. Met a weapon artist killed more soldiers and found a crypt with skeletons. After a few tries and running back and forth at opened the door to face some assassin. He wasn’t too hard, and now I have a talisman.

#### Day 6

I got back to the Fringe with the killer chariot, jumped down the ledge and managed to dodge the scions and grab the Erdtree's Favor talisman. Done.
Another loose end was the Murkwater Cave where I missed the "boss" Patches. Decided not to kill him when he surrendered, so now he is a merchant there. Done.

And just outside the cave, Bloody Fucking Invading Finger Nerijus. After a few tries managed to run around long enough to the Hunter to join the fight. Killed him too. Done.

I was really into checking off stuff on my list, so... Margit. Why not? I already gained some levels and had my rotting spirit dog. Summoned the sorcerer and jumped right in. He went down. On the first try. OMG! "I shall remember thee, Tarnished!"

[video]

Why not push forward. Entered the castle through the side opening after killing the servant with the attitude, I have yet to bring his Bell Bearing to the Twin Maiden Husks in Roundtable Hold. Reading a little about it I've probably made the right decision to kill this bastard early on. He steals runes on death and would have locked me in the room with that damn Knight.

So I went all the way up the side of the castle, killed everyone, gathered everything I saw. I probably cheesed the knight in the Rusty Key room. He stuck heind the door, so I could chip away his health from outside. Still took me quite some time to reach the top. The knight at the top gave me a really hard time.

On the way I found some claws, which I really like. They are fast and build up blood loss, very cool. From the top I parkoured the roofs and somehow managed to get to the next Grace with all my runes. Then the next and finally the one just outside Godrick. This was the perfect point to call this a day.

#### Day 7

I'm not ready for Godrick. That's for sure. So I have to get stronger. Started to venture out from the Graces, and found some nice rune farming areas, but there are a couple of very hard mobs... really frustrating to spend 30 mins getting the runes back and dying right after. I have to keep my distance for now.

There erre two elevators that I could use when I was acscending the castle. I decided to find a way to turn them on. One could be reached from jumping down the north wall along the cliffs. Well falling into a bush really. For the other I had to get past one of the Scions.

On the way I found a quest item for Roderika, the girl outside the castle, who gave me the jellyfish ashes. She got her spirits back and decided to move to Roundtable Hold, where after some discussion with the blacksmith, she set up her spirit tuner shop.

I figured out that I can hold my Hookclaws in both hands, becoming a meetgrinder. Finally managed to kill the big guy outside the elevator room. Actually several times, and one point he dropped his Omen Cleaver, my first great sword, baby.

Upgraded my claws and some other armamanents and even my rotten dog spirit friend, and then, I saw the Tree Sentinel... jumped on Torrent, called the dog and gave him hell with the Omen Cleaver. It took some 10ish tries, gave enough time for crimson rot to kick in, then I just had to keep my distance. A fine closing of the day.

#### Day 8

Felled a Tree Sentinel, I’m powerful… well not yet. I can't use Torrent with Godrick, so pulling this off again is out of the question. I decided to explore Eastern Limgrave, from the south now. Cleared Fort Haight and strolled north, where I heard some wolf howling around some ruins, but only found a bear… a huge one. I already sew these big guys after the chest in Patches cave teleported me to this part. So, while I managed to kill one I was running around avoiding them and finally found the map of this region.

Followed the road around some huge tree and found a round building with a magic elevator that toon me down to Siofra River, deep underground, where the glowing crystals in the ceiling are like a beautiful night sky.

Enemies are tough here so I was mostly strolling around with Torrent gathering stuff. Found some interesting materials and the map of this area too.
I was actually heading north in Limgrave East to get to the point D showed me in Roundtable Hold. So I continued my way and found Kenneth Haight, the wannabe ruler of this land. He asked me to clear his fort, and I told him I did already so he gave me a fancy dagger and asked me pledge allegiance and to visit him, to be knighted.

Moving on I found the ruins of the Church of Marika, and was rewarded with the flask of mixed physiks. This will come in handy.

I found the waygate and met the Beast Clergyman… well he is something, eating deathroots, but he gave me some useful stuff in exchange. Job done, lets get back to Limgrave and meet Kenneth in his Fort…

Well, communicating with demi-humans, sure… didn't work out too well for him. The fort was overrun. Clearing it and meeting the lord rewarded me with only a sad story. Well, not becoming a knight, just yet.

From here I ventured south to the Weeping Penninsula. Beyond the bridge I found Irina, a visually impaired girl waiting for his father, the warden on Castle Morne. She asked me to deliver a letter to her father.

Castle Morne was full of rotten strays and misbegotten. Advancing up I took a turn and ended up behind the castle, followed the path and reached the shore with a boss arena. It took a few tries, but dual wielding the enhanced hookclawas with my scarlet rot puppy, and(!) setting the focus on the boss helped a lot. Leonine Misbegotten felled, the Grafted Blade Greatsword looted and… Edgar is now on revenge for his daughter. The poor girl was murdered while I was delivering her letter.

[video]

Now I was feeling powerful, so gave Godrick a try. Went quite well, phase 2 in a few seconds. Let’s start with him tomorrow.

#### Day 9

I went straight to Godrick and gave him hell. It was epic, just a little left from his health, he grabbed me with his dragon arm, smashed me to the ground, flames everywhere, almost dying, when scarlet rot gave him the final blow.

[video]

Got his depleted great rune. I knew where I have to take it. The only problem was that I didn't know the way. Also Kenneth is nowhere to be seen in the throne room. Why he is not around is a mystery for now. Through the throne room I found a way to the region north. But for now my goal is the divine tower.

Took some time to find the way around the ballistas, but I finally reached the beginning of the great bridge. On the way I found the Claw Talisman and opened the main gate. Fought my way through an army of soldiers just to find the entrance guarded by a lion with a blade and attached to its right leg... I don't have time for this, just ran past and discovered the grace beyond the gate. Still I felt obliged to kill the beast, so I went back before I continued my journey to the tower.

At the top of the bridge there were three colossals. Two with axes and one with bow and arrows... huge arrows. I managed to kill one before at Castle Morne, but three, all aggroing the moment I step on the bridge. No way. I somehow managed to get past them and used the waygate that took me to the divine tower. There I could restore the great rune. 

[video]

Back in the Roundtable Hold I enterd the inner chamber, where Enia told me the message of the two fingers… they are fingers, huge fingers.

#### Day 10

I had some leftover business at Castle Morne, so I went back and killed all the Misbegotten on the huge burning pile of... whatever. Beyond that was the armory, where I got the Claymore. This was the last piece of equipment required for the Berserker Build, that gave me some guidance in the first few days. Since then I grew fond of the Hookclaws and my Rotten Puppy... I'll call him Roppy. Plus, I have the Erdtree's Favor and Twinblade talismans equiped. I have to get close with claws in both hand and land a chain attack. With luck this builds up blood loss and also trigger the Twinblade. Worked perfectly on the Leonine Misbegotten two days ago.

There was still a lot to discover on the Weeping Peninsula so I tracked back, and found the Impaler's catacomb. Opening the boss arena was fun. Imps are causing me less problems, but I need the shield here. These annoyingly agile little pests build up blood loss. To my luck the boss here was another Watchdog, similar to the first larger enemy I killed, and four imps all attacking at the same time. Took me and Roppy a few rounds to kill them, before I could focus on the boss. Dodging his moves and punishing with blood loss combos. Wasn't easy, but it worked. Left the place with Demi-human Ashes and some Grave Glovewort, just what I needed to upgrade Roppy at Roderika.

[video]

#### Day 11

Once I upgraded Roppy in Roundtable Hold I went back to the Weeping Peninsula. Started my venture west and of the main road and quickly reached a minor Erdtree and next to it an Erdtree Avatar. This was some great fight, it had great moves, but i managed to get him on the first try. Found some tears for mixed physical, damage reduction and health over time.

[video]

Then further east I started hearing a bell. Looking around I spotted it. A wandering mausoleum. I read that it can duplicate a remembrance, so I started scraping the white stuff off its legs, until it finally rested so I could enter. Duplicated Godricks Remembrance, I probably want both boss weapons.

Next to where the mausoleum landed, there was a cave entrance. In it lots of poison, and rats, huge rats, and flowers, and a huge boss flower—similar to what I saw in Limgrave, should check. More so, since I managed to kill this on my first try. Nice.

[video]

#### Day 12

Today I continued my journey on the Weeping Peninsula. I knew there were a couple more dungeons to explore, but first I visited the Fourth Church of Marika.

Then I followed the coast, full of zombies, to the Tower of Return. Why is it called like that? I climbed to the top to kill the foot soldier with the ballista and found a chest... which teleported me to the Royal Capital... the Tower of Return... I get it.

Well the capital is so much stronger than me, luckily I found a grace just outside and escaped back to were I was. I went back to the Tower, climbed to the top and there was the chest again, closed, so I opened it... and returned to the Capital. Again. The Tower of Return... *sigh*

Back on at the merchant's shack I decided not to return to the Tower. Instead I went east and found a strang circular area with stone worms around it. I saw one like it before near the bridge coming from Limgrave. This is an Evergaol, some kind of prison, with a powerful entity within. If you go in, you either die or kill the inhabitant. I entered the Weeping Hollow Evergaol and managed to kill The Ancient Hero of Zamor on the second try and received Radagan's Scarseal.

[video]

Further along I found the Tombswort Catacombs. This place had skeletons all over, and fire traps, but also lots of upgrade materials. There was a room blocked by grey mist. I should get back here with Stonesword keys.
The boss was a strange black phantom creature, that kept teleporting around the area. That was the most difficult about it. When I finally got close for a few hits, it died quickly. My reward was Leuthel the Headless Spirit Ashes.

[video]

I saw on the map there was another church up north so I went there. I got a Sacred Tear and had a brief chat with Melina beside the grace.
I entered the forest and found some ruins swarming with Misbegotten, in the middle there was a huge one that could do magic. On my second try I rode in on Trorrent buffed with mixed physics and managed to kill is. The little one all covered in fear after that. I got a staff and the spell this thing was using.

Deeper in the forest I found another of those candle holders. After touching it, a ghost of a noble starts to walk, leaving glowing footprints on its way. It lead me to the Earthbore Cave. Entering I saw a chest but stepping closer the ground gave away and I fell in a pit full of rats. I managed to get out and found a huge Runebears. Killed it and got the Spelldeake Talisman, which protects against magic damage. Back at the beginning I found the chest, but as you could expect there was nothing really valuable in there, just a pickled turtle neck.

[video]

I left the forest south and found the Morne Tunnel. It was some kind of mine, full of smithstones and misbegotten. The boss was a Scaly Misbegotten and killing it earned me a Rusty Anchor, a strange choice for a weapon.

[video]

The only thing left for the day was to return to the Tower of Return and finally clear that place. This time I managed to kill the Holy knight and left the teleporter chest alone. I managed to kill a huge land octopus nearby and finally called it a day. Tomorrow I'll leave the Weeping Penninsula behind.

#### Day 13

I remembered another Evergaol in Limgrave, right from the bridge to the Weeping Peninsula. I traveled there and it was active, no need for stonesword keys here. However the prisoner, Bloodhound Knight Darrivill was tough as hell. He was jumping and shadow stepping around, slashing with his great sword, building blood loss. It was almost impossible to get close enough with the claws without getting killed. I dodged around like crazy, replenishing health whenever possible, and after several tries, I got lucky and managed to get close to him three times, aggressively dodgeing toward him while he was attacking. My reward: his very own Bloodhound's Fang greatsword, with blood loss, oh yeah, totally worth it.

There was one more evergaol I saw on the map on Stormhill. The entity in it was a Crucible Knight... he was tough. After a few miserable attempts I decided to come back later. The reward I would get is a spell that I can live without for now.

---

While I was around I checked the area southwest of the castle. There was a colossus, that I managed to kill and a side entrance to the castle gates, where I found a talisman that enhances arrow damage.

After this I finally decided to check the Lakes. Started out from the church in the water until I found the map of the region. Then I went to shore east and found a gateway. 

What could go wrong, I entered and was transported all the way to the end of the road, deep within the region. There was a strange magical door with a blue glowing pattern, but decided not to that way, instead I started to fight some enemies, but wasn't careful and got killed with 11k runes on me and the last grace was way back south.

I had to find my way back to the gateway to reach the point of my death, without accidentally being killed. Somehow I managed this and started backtracking on Torrent. Found the map of this region and activated about three graves. 
Back near the broken bridge to Limgrave I fought a giant and found a spear in the back of a carriage, and also met some enemies who are slashing like crazy at all directions, I left them be for now.

I came to know there that Ash of War: Golden Vow dropped by a Godrick Knight near the Colosseum. I went there, where I was immediately invaded by Recusant Henricus, but I handled him just fine. South of the building I found the Knight and handled him while Riding Torrent. Done.

I decided to travel Liurnia again, but now the western side, which was yet to be mapped. I started my journey northwest from the Church of Irith. Through the swamp I arrived at the Village of Albinaurics, these pour souls were damned by curse mongers, or so I hear from Albus, an old guy disguised as a pot. He gave me the right side of the Haligtree Sacred Medallion before dying. Exploring this cursed village I stumbled into the Omenkiller, who I managed to beat and receive the Crusible Knot Talisman.

[video]

I left the village north and found a Converted Tower. Had to climb the outer wall and jump across with Torrent to reach the top where I found a Memory Stone. Further north I arrived at the foot of a Minor Erdtree, and the Erdtree Avatar guarding it. This wasn't so easy as the previous Avatar, but I managed to give Roppy enough time to build up scarlet rot, then I just had to stay away until the creature was dead. rewarding me with Cerulean and Raptured Crystal Tears.

[video]

Further north I wanted to take some rest at the Revenger's Shack... but the Revenger, Edgar was home, invading me... who invaded his home, I guess. Well too bad, he fought well, but still fell, dropping his Banished Knight's Halberd+8 and Raw Meat Dumplings? This thing is disgusting, restores half of your health, but also inflicts poison. No wonder this can't be crafted.

[video]

Past the shack I found the Cuckoo's Evergaol and imprisoned within: Bols, Carion Knight. He was a giant with a huge sword and a helmet, casting Greatblade Phalanx, sending three magic sword projectiles. With all my available buffs this fight needed several tries, but I felt I have a chance, so I kept pushing and the Hookclaws still don't disappoint.

[video]

I followed the road, fought some agitated jellyfish and found a Jellyfish Shield. Now I'm walking around with a huge translucent blob on my back. From here I didn't stop until Caria Manor. There I was dealt a bunch of hands, who I had to deal with. This place is full of magic, and dangerous enemies. I might not be strong enough for this place yet.

#### Day 14

No, I'm definitely not strong enough. Spent some time getiing myself smashed by the Carion Knight giant over and over. I have to figure out something, maybe just leave this place for now. Or... let Roppy tank the giant and run past? I have to think this through.

I decided to check the minor erdteee and its Avatar in northwest Caelid. But first, there was an invader, Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater who I had some business with. Dealing with her was much smoother than I expected so I continued towards the minor erdtree. 

[video]

Well… the avatar proved to be tough. It also uses scarlet rot, and resistant to it (sorry Roppy). I need a decent fire build before I can face this boss again.

So then, let's check the black whetknife in the Siofra River… actually the knife is in the city one level above the river region, and the two are not connected. Great. Anyway while I was there I found a point of interest northeast on the map and tried to reach it, while gathering materials and runes on the way. It was an elevator, locked by a gargoyle statue. It took me… back to Caelid. Great.

No matter, then I should do some exploring here, at least gather the maps. I managed to do that after much running around and avoiding many dangerous foes. But then I found some ruins with kamikaze burning zombies. Killed a bunch of them avoiding the flame thrower chariots, when I found the way underground to a boss arena, with two(!) Mad Pumpkin Head bosses. OMFG! Actually the first try went rather well, I killed one, before the other finished me. This gave me some hope, so I kept trying and managed to beat them. My reward was a Visage Shield, which I can't use yet, but it is nice nevertheless. I decided this was the right time to call it a day.

[video]

#### Day 15

So, I have some loose ends to tie in Limgrave, let's start with the howling at the mist ruins. Kale told me to snap my fingers there. I don't know if it was necessary to kill the runebear, but I did it anyway, it might be sleeping there nice and peaceful, but if I wake it up, it's not nice and definitely not peaceful.

Beilee, the half wolf was waiting for me in a dark corner of the ruins and ask for my help tracking down someone called Darrivill. Oh, I know that guy, back at the Evergaol. I went back just to find Bailee there waiting for me, he said his thanks for my help with a somber smithing stone, which I actually used to upgrade the Bloodfang, it was about time.

I remembered some ruins nearby with a dangerous plant, it was really scary before so I kept my distance, but now felt like giving it a go. On the way from the Evergaol I saw the caravan, omg, two impaled trolls dragging a carriage followed by a dozen nobles, soldiers on foot and horseback. Anothe intimidating sight I was only watching from the distance. Now I decided to see what they are carrying. I have come long way, killing the whole entourage including the trolls only took a few minutes and my reward was a great axe.

Now back to the Waypoint ruins. Finished the plant, it was actually very similar to the boss version I fought before, but I was poisoned and used all my FP here and at the caravan, so when I entered the boss room the Mad Pumpkinhead smashed me to pulp. No matter, had some rest at the nearby grace and gave it another go. Not it melted like butter. 

[video]

And my reward: behind door "only one" there was a lady waiting among glintstone crystals. An academy dropout, who offered her services to teahc me sorcery. Well only if could use any. who knows, maybe at a later time.

Next stop, the Coastal Cave, well, look at that, I found a frail figure crawled up in a knot near the grave. It was Boc, the friendly demi-human, who was turned into a tree. I freed him a few days ago and he was telling me about the bullies in his cave. Now, let's see about that. I cleared the cave, and recovered Boc's sawing needle and a sawing kit. Now he has a purpose and I can alter my Armor, neat.

[video]

There was a tunnel leading outside the boss arena, I took that instead of teleporting back to the beginning and boy it was a good decision. I came out to the on a nearby island with the Church of Dragon something on it. Here I could learn dragon incantations in exchange for dragon hearts... but where could I get one. I remember a dragon in the lake, he is on my list.

I tracked down the dragon, and gave him hell with Roppy and the Hookclaws. I was burned a few times pretty bad, but eventually he fell and I got his heart.

[video]

Just a little north from where the dragon fell was a tunnel entrance. I was in a similar tunnel before on the Weeping Penninsula, lots of upgrade materials inside, and and boss, a Stonedigger Troll in this case. Beating it rewarded me with the Roar Talisman.

[video]

I travelled further north and cleared a cemetery below Stormhill, while this wasn't the place I was looking for I found Godrick Soldier ashes. I actually took the wrong turn looking for Groveside cave which was just north of the Church of Elijah. In the cave I beat the Beastman of Farum Azula to earn the Flamedrake talisman. This would have been useful fighting the dragon before, innit?

Back on the beach near the coastal cave I encountered an invisible thing that was rolling around in a pattern leaving golden marks on the ground. I saw a similar thing in Caelid, but now I managed to kill it. It was a "dung beetle" and dropped an ash of war. Now I knew I had to track down a beetle in Caelid, maybe it was the same? I found the invisible beetle and managed to kill it, but it wasn't the ash I was looking for. So I kept searching further.

In the middle of the rotting lake I was invaded. Managed to kill the invader, but lost a bunch of runes, and at the moment of my victory some big ass soldiers appeared to finishe me off... This place is hell.

Never mind. I stood up and found the beetle and applied the Lifesteal Fists on my hookclaws. Oh yeah. I found a misty cave entrance nearby, decided to open it. It was the Gaol Cave, imprisoned within a bunch of those kamikaze zombies, wardens and at the end a Frenzied Duelist. I beat him on the second try and leaving his room through a tunnel I was greeted with the calming view of Limgrave... such a relief. And just in front of me and a new sword.

[video]

I was tired, had to go back to Roundtable Hold and maybe tell people about my adventures. Hmm... somethings not right. It's dark here. From my left an invader came into view and sliced me up. What is happening!? Next time I was prepared. Finishing him gave me some nasty fist weapons and turned the place back to its original state, but hey, the grumpy guy outside grandpa's room is gone, and his Armor laying around. So you were the one, I never trusted you. 

[video]

I felt restless, so I decided to take a look at the eastern side of Liurnia. I hate the soldiers with four hands, they shoot arrows like crazy and when you get close it feels like in a blender. Damn.
There are also a lot of wolves around here. And they are tougher. While I was escaping a pack I stumbled upon a Tibia Mariner, the death creature with the boat. I liked this fight in Limgrave before so I decided to give it a try. It want well and I got skeletal bandit ashes too. Nice ending of a long day. Time to rest.

[video]

#### Day 16

I stayed around the eastern part of Liurnia. Found a statue that was leading me to Cliffbttom Catacombs. So far this was the most difficult dungeon I attempted. First, the obvious way does not lead to the lever. Oh no, it leads to traps, imps and onens guarding a few materials and a scythe, which is not that bad to be fair, but then where is the lever.

Turné out one has to jump down below, where one of the omens stand guard. If you do it right, you fall into the bushes and crouch immediately, then it might not notice you. The other one is patrolling the circular corridor. There are bushes everywhere so you can stealth around. Leaving through the only exit leads to a room with another big guy, with a big ass sword. I'm sure there is a clever way to kill it, but I didn't have much patience at this point so I tried to rush past it. Finally a ladder, I climbed and there was the lever, but that thing also climbed up, what the hell. Pulled the lever, quickly grabbed some item on the right and jumped down to the ramp. The thing did too, it was following me, so I ran, all the way to the elevator.

Finally the boss arena was open, so after some rest I went straight there. It was a watchdog, of course, but this one wielded a staff and used glintstone magic. No surprise so close to Raya Lazarus. Took me two attempts, I melted it's HP while Roppy tanked, was rewarded with the Kaiden Sellsword Ashes.

While rushing in the lever area I missed one item, I have to come back for.

[video]

From here I travelled west through the lake. After killing some creepy hunchback enemies I found a girl, agreed to find her stolen necklace and also Patches, so set up shop here. I sat beside him by the campfire and thought about how difficult this day was.
