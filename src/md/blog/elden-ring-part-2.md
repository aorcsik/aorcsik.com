#### Day 10

I had some leftover business at [Castle Morne](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Morne), so I went back and killed all the [misbegotten](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Misbegotten) on the huge burning pile of... whatever. Beyond that was the armory, where I got the [Claymore](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Claymore). This was the last piece of equipment required for the [Berserker Build](https://fextralife.com/elden-ring-berserker-guide-vagabond-build-for-beginners/), which gave me some guidance in the first few days. 

Since then, I have grown fond of the [Hookclaws](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hookclaws) and my [Rotten Puppy](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray). I'll call him *Roppy*. Plus, I have the [Erdtree's Favor](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree's+Favor) and [Twinblade Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Twinblade+Talisman) equipped, which I had found when I was first here. I have to get close with claws in both hands and land a chain attack, but with a little luck, this builds up [blood loss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hemorrhage) and also triggers the Twinblade. Worked perfectly on the [Leonine Misbegotten](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leonine+Misbegotten) two days ago. Roppy takes the boss' attention and also inflicts scarlet rot while I grind it from the back. By the time Roppy is gone, there is just a little health left that is handled by scarlet rot, while I keep my distance and land one or two hits when there is an opening.

There was still a lot to discover on the Weeping Peninsula, so I tracked back and found the [Impaler's Catacombs](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Impaler's+Catacombs). Opening the boss arena was fun. [Imps](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Imp) are causing me fewer problems, but I needed the shield here. These annoyingly agile little pests build up [blood loss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hemorrhage). To my luck, the boss here was another [Erdtree Burial Watchdog](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Burial+Watchdog), similar to the first larger enemy I killed, and four imps all attacking at the same time. It took Roppy and me a few rounds to kill them before I could focus on the boss, dodging his moves and punishing him with blood-loss combos. Wasn't easy, but it worked. Left the place with [Demi-Human Ashes](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Ashes) and some [Grave Glovewort](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Grave+Gloveworts), just what I needed to upgrade Roppy at [Roderika](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roderika).

#### Day 11

Once I upgraded *[Roppy](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rotten+Stray+Ashes)* in [Roundtable Hold](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Roundtable+Hold) I went back to the [Weeping Peninsula](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Weeping+Peninsula). I started my venture west of the main road and quickly reached a [Minor Erdtree](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+(Weeping+Peninsula)) and, next to it, an [Erdtree Avatar](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar). This was a great fight. The boss had great moves, but I got him on the first try using my strategy. Found [Opaline Bubbletear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Opaline+Bubbletear) (damage reduction) and [Crimsonburst Crystal Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crimsonburst+Crystal+Tear) (health over time) for my mixed Physick.

Then, further east, I started hearing a bell. Not the faint tingling of a [Teardrop Scarab](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Teardrop+Scarab), but something bigger and louder. Looking around I spotted it. A [Walking Mausoleum](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Walking+Mausoleum). I heard that Iside one could duplicate a [remembrances](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance). But how to get in? I started hitting its legs, and some white stuff started to come off. After a while, it collapsed so I could enter. I duplicated the [Remembrance of the Grafted](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Remembrance+of+the+Grafted), I probably want both boss weapons at some point.

Next to where the mausoleum landed, there was the entrance to the [Tombsward Cave](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tombsward+Cave). Inside, I found lots of poison, rats, [giant rats](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Rat), [flowers](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+Sprout), and a huge boss flower, [Miranda the Blighted Bloom](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Miranda+the+Blighted+Bloom). It was similar to what I saw back in [Limgrave](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Limgrave) near [Waypoint Ruins](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Waypoint+Ruins). I should probably check, more so since I managed to kill this on my first try. I got the [Viridian Amber Medallion](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Viridian+Amber+Medallion). Nice.

#### Day 12

Today, I continued my journey on the [Weeping Peninsula](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Weeping+Peninsula). I knew there were a couple more dungeons to explore, but first I visited the [Fourth Church of Marika](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fourth+Church+of+Marika) for a [Sacred Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear).

Then I followed the coast, full of [zombies](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Corpse), to the [Tower of Return](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tower+of+Return). Why is it called that? I climbed to the top to kill the foot soldier with the ballista and found a chest, which teleported me to the Divine Bridge at [Leyndell Royal Capital](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Leyndell+Royal+Capital)—the Tower of Return. Now I get it.

The first and only enemy here was a [Golem](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem), and its first hit killed me. Luckily, I found a site of grace just outside and escaped back to where I came from. I went back to the Tower, climbed to the top, and there was the chest again. It was closed, so I opened it and returned to the Capital. Again. The Tower of Return... What was I expecting? *sigh*

Back at the [merchant's shack](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Isolated+Merchant's+Shack+%28Weeping+Peninsula%29) I decided not to return to the tower. Instead, I went east and found a strange circular area with [stone worms](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Abnormal+Stone+Cluster) around it. I saw one like it before near the bridge coming from Limgrave, but it looked scary. So, this place was an [Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Weeping+Evergaol), some kind of interdimensional prison cell with a powerful entity within trapped for eternity. I had to activate it with [Stonesword Keys](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key). I entered and got killed. I appeared just outside, I could even collect my lost runes without entering again. Now that I knew who the inmate was, I could enter prepared and managed to kill the [Ancient Hero of Zamor](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ancient+Hero+of+Zamor), and received [Radagon's Scarseal](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Radagon's+Scarseal).

[Sir Oakheart vs. Ancient Hero of Zamor (Weeping Evergaol)](https://youtu.be/9UhbcdAEgcI#embed)

Further along, I found the [Tombsward Catacombs](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tombsward+Catacombs). This place had skeletons everywhere, fire traps, and lots of upgraded materials. One of the rooms was blocked by grey mist. I should get back here with [Stonesword Keys](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key).

The boss was a strange black phantom creature, a [Cemetery Shade](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cemetery+Shade) that kept teleporting around the area. That was the most difficult about it. When I finally got close for a few hits, it died quickly. My reward was [Lhutel the Headless Spirit Ashes](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lhutel+the+Headless).

[Sir Oakheart vs. Cemetery Shade (Tombsward Catacombs)](https://youtu.be/Ok6RE0w_zzM#embed)

On the map, I saw another [church](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Pilgrimage) up north, so I went there. I found a [Sacred Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Tear) and had a brief chat with [Melina](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Melina) while resting at the site of grace.

I entered the nearby forest and found some [ruins](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Forest+Ruins) swarming with Demi-humans. In the middle was a huge one that could do magic. On my second try, I rode in on Torrent buffed with Mixed Physick and managed to kill it. The little ones were all cowering in fear after that. I got the [Demi-Human Queen's Staff](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Queen's+Staff)... so the big one was their [queen](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Demi-Human+Queen), and the [Crystal Burst](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crystal+Burst) sorcery she was using.

Deeper in the forest I found another of those candle holders. After touching it, a ghost of a noble starts to walk, leaving glowing footprints on its way. It led me to the [Earthbore Cave](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Earthbore+Cave). Upon entering, I saw a chest, but as I stepped closer, the ground gave away, and I fell into a pit full of [giant rats](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Giant+Rat). I escaped them to find a huge [Runebear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Runebear) towering over me. I killed it and got the [Spelldeake Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spelldrake+Talisman), which increases protection against magic damage. Back at the beginning, I found the chest, but as you could expect, there was nothing really valuable in there, just a [pickled turtle neck](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Pickled+Turtle+Neck).

[Sir Oakheart vs. Runebear (Earthbore Cave)](https://youtu.be/fetoD8Bj0PQ#embed)

I left the forest south and found the [Morne Tunnel](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Morne+Tunnel). It was some kind of mine, full of [smithing stones](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smithing+Stones) and [misbegotten](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Misbegotten). The boss was a [Scaly Misbegotten](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scaly+Misbegotten) and killing it earned me a [Rusted Anchor](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rusted+Anchor), a strange choice for a weapon.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Scaly Misbegotten (Morne Tunnel)](https://youtu.be/NiFJeh37RKk#embed)

The only thing left for the day was to return to the [Tower of Return](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Tower+of+Return) and finally clear the place. This time, I managed to defeat the mounted [Godrick Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godrick+Knight) and leave the teleporter chest alone. I had my revenge, but not much loot. I killed a huge land octopus nearby and called it a day. Tomorrow, I'll leave the Weeping Peninsula behind.

#### Day 13

I remembered another [Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Forlorn+Hound+Evergaol) in [Limgrave](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Limgrave), on the right side of the bridge to the Weeping Peninsula. I traveled there, and it was active. There was no need for [Stonesword Keys](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key) here. However, the prisoner, [Bloodhound Knight Darrivill](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound+Knight+Darriwil), was tough as hell. He was jumping and shadow-stepping while slashing with his great sword, inflicting [blood loss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hemorrhage). It was almost impossible to reach him with the Hookclaws without getting killed. I dodged around like crazy, replenishing my health whenever possible, and after several tries, I got lucky and managed to get close three times, aggressively dodging toward him while he was attacking. My reward: his very own [Bloodhound's Fang](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound's+Fang) greatsword, with blood loss. Oh yeah, totally worth it. *(I could have used some help from an NPC summon here, but at the time I wasn't even aware of the existence of Blaidd.)*

[Sir Oakheart vs. Bloodhound Knight Darrivill](https://youtu.be/uksb7we9fNI#embed)

There was one more on my map, [Stormhill Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill+Evergaol). The entity in it was a [Crucible Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Knight)... he was tough, I mean very tough. After a few miserable attempts, I decided to come back later. *(Or never?)* The reward I would get is a spell I can live without. For now. *(Or forever?... Btw, there is a great [Carbot Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYokDk7dNt4) about this particular boss.)*

While I was there, I looked around the fields southwest of the castle. There was a slumbering [Golem](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem), that I managed to kill and a side entrance to the castle gates, where I found the [Arrow's Reach Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow's+Reach+Talisman).

After all this, I finally decided to check the [Lakes](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Liurnia+of+the+Lakes). I started out at the [Church of Irith](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Irith) where I met [Thops](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thops), a sorcerer scholar who was locked out when the Academy magically blocked their gates after the Shattering. He was begging for some runes, so I gave him some. I set out in the water until I found the [map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Liurnia,+East)) of the region. Then I went to shore east and found a waygate among the [ruins](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Purified+Ruins). 

What could go wrong, I entered and was teleported all the way to the end of the road, deep within the region. There was a strange magical door with a blue, glowing pattern, but I decided not to go that way. Instead, I started to fight some enemies but wasn't careful. I was killed with 11k runes on me, and the last site of grace was way back south. I had to find my way back to the waygate to reach the point of my death, without accidentally being killed. *(I didn't know at the time that a site of grace was just steps away from where they waygate took me.)*

Somehow, I managed to get there and started backtracking on Torrent. On my way, I found the [map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Liurnia,+North)) of this region and about three sites of grace.

Back near the collapsed bridge to Limgrave, I fought a [troll](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll) and found the [Treespear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Treespear) in the back of a carriage. I also met some [four-arm enemies](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Marionette+Soldier) who were slashing like crazy in all directions. I left them be for now. *(a.k.a. I ran for my life as fast as I could)*

I came to know that [Ash of War: Golden Vow](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Golden+Vow) is dropped by a [Godrick Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godrick+Knight) near the [Limgrave Colosseum](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Limgrave+Colosseum). I went there, where I was immediately invaded by [Recusant Henricus](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Recusant+Henricus), but I handled him just fine. He dropped the [Hammer Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hammer+Talisman). I found the Knight south of the building and defeated him while riding Torrent. Done.

I decided to go back to [Liurnia](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Liurnia+of+the+Lakes) again, but now the western side, which was yet to be mapped. I started my journey northwest from the [Church of Irith](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Irith). Through the swamp I arrived at the [Village of the Albinaurics](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Village+of+the+Albinaurics), these poor souls, [First-Generation Albinaurics](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/First-Generation+Albinauric) and their village was devestate by cursemongers, or so I heard from [Albus](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albus), an old albinauric disguised as a pot. He gave me the [right half of the Haligtree Sacred Medallion](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligtree+Secret+Medallion+(Right)) before dying and asked me to bring it to an albinauric woman named [Latenna](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Latenna). While exploring this cursed village, I met [Nepheli Loux](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nepheli+Loux), who was outraged about the fate of these people and his father's involvement. Further on I ran into an [Omenkiller](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Omenkiller), who I managed to beat and receive the [Crucible Knot Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Knot+Talisman). *(I could have summoned Nepheli Loux for this fight, but I didn't see her summon sign.)*

[Sir Oakheart vs. Omenkiller](https://youtu.be/o3yaWGfi2oc#embed)

I left the village north and found the [Converted Tower](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Converted+Tower). I had to climb the outer wall and jump across with Torrent to reach the top where I found a [Memory Stone](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Memory+Stone). Further north, I arrived at the roots of a [Minor Erdtree](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+(Liurnia+Southwest)) and the [Erdtree Avatar](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar) guarding it. This wasn't as easy as the previous Avatar, but I managed to give Roppy enough time to build up scarlet rot, and then I just had to stay away until the creature was dead. My rewards were the [Cerulean Crystal Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Crystal+Tear) and the [Ruptured Crystal Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruptured+Crystal+Tear).

[Sir Oakheart vs. Erdtree Avatar (Liurnia Southwest)](https://youtu.be/UkYpguMwm6g#embed)

I continued my journey north and wanted to rest at the nearby [shack](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revenger's+Shack). When I arrived, I saw [Edgar](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Edgar+the+Revenger) from [Castle Morne](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Castle+Morne) was home. Hey buddy, how is your revenge? Oh, my god, he is invading me! Poor guy went crazy with revenge. He fought well but still fell, dropping his [Banished Knight's Halberd](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Banished+Knight's+Halberd)+8 and some [Raw Meat Dumplings](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raw+Meat+Dumpling). He had some lying around in the shack, too. This thing is disgusting. It restores half of your health but also inflicts poison. No wonder it can't be crafted.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Edgar the Revenger](https://youtu.be/I-XUxNMuKag#embed)

Past the shack, I found [Cuckoo's Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cuckoo's+Evergaol) and imprisoned within [Bols, Carian Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bols,+Carian+Knight). He was a troll with a huge sword and a helmet, casting [Greatblade Phalanx](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatblade+Phalanx), sending three magic sword projectiles... well this is a sight. With all my available buffs, this fight needed several tries, but I felt I had a chance, so I kept pushing, and voilá, my [Hookclaws](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hookclaws) are still amazing.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Bold, Carian Knight](https://youtu.be/gmAtywJeJHs#embed)

I followed the road, fought some agitated [Spirit Jellyfish](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Jellyfish), and found a [Jellyfish Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jellyfish+Shield). I was walking around with a huge translucent blob on my back from then on. From here I didn't stop until [Caria Manor](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caria+Manor). There, I was dealt a bunch of [hands](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Fingercreeper), that I had to deal with. These creatures frequently drop [Somber Smithing Stones](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Somber+Smithing+Stones). This place was full of magic and dangerous enemies like [Raya Lucaria Soldier](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raya+Lucaria+Soldier) puppets, [Direwolves](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Direwolf), and even a [Troll Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll+Knight), like the one who I fought in the Evergaol. I might not be strong enough for this place yet. *(At the time I didn't know I was just a few steps away from the boss, but leaving to get stronger was a good decision.)*
