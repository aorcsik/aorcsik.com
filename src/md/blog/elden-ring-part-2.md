#### Day 11

Once I upgraded Roppy in Roundtable Hold I went back to the Weeping Peninsula. Started my venture west of the main road and quickly reached a Minor Erdtree and next to it an Erdtree Avatar. This was some great fight, it had great moves, but I managed to get him on my first try. Found some tears for my mixed physick, damage reduction and health over time.

Then further east I started hearing a bell. Looking around I spotted it. A wandering mausoleum. I read that it can duplicate a remembrance, so I started scraping the white stuff off its legs, until it finally rested so I could enter. Duplicated Godricks Remembrance, I probably want both boss weapons.

Next to where the mausoleum landed, there was the entrance to the Tombsword Cave. In it lots of poison, and rats, huge rats, and flowers, and a huge boss flower, Miranda the Blighted Bloom. It was similar to what I saw back in Limgrave near Waypoint Ruins. I should probably check. More so, since I managed to kill this on my first try. Igot the Viridian Amber Medallion. Nice.

#### Day 12

Today I continued my journey on the Weeping Peninsula. I knew there were a couple more dungeons to explore, but first I visited the Fourth Church of Marika.

Then I followed the coast, full of zombies, to the Tower of Return. Why is it called like that? I climbed to the top to kill the foot soldier with the ballista and found a chest... which teleported me to the Royal Capital... the Tower of Return... I get it.

Well the first enemy in the capital one hit killed me, luckily I found a grace just outside and escaped back to were I was. I went back to the Tower, climbed to the top and there was the chest again, closed, so I opened it... and returned to the Capital. Again. The Tower of Return... What was I expecting? *sigh*

Back on at the merchant's shack I decided not to return to the tower. Instead I went east and found a strang circular area with stone worms around it. I saw one like it before near the bridge coming from Limgrave, but it looked scary. So this is an Evergaol, some kind of interdimensional prison cell, with a powerful entity within, trapped for eternity, or... so I entered, and was killed. I appeared just outside, I could even collect my lost runes without entering again. Now that I knew who the inmate was, I could enter the Weeping Hollow Evergaol prepared and managed to kill The Ancient Hero of Zamor this time and received Radagon's Scarseal.

Further along I found the Tombsword Catacombs. This place had skeletons all over, and fire traps, but also lots of upgrade materials. There was a room blocked by grey mist. I should get back here with Stonesword Keys.

The boss was a strange black phantom creature, a Cemetery Shade that kept teleporting around the area. That was the most difficult about it. When I finally got close for a few hits, it died quickly. My reward was Lhutel the Headless Spirit Ashes.

I saw on the map that there was another church up north so I went there. I got a Sacred Tear and had a brief chat with Melina beside the site of grace.

I entered the nearby forest and found some ruins swarming with Demi-humans, in the middle there was a huge one that could do magic. On my second try I rode in on Trorrent buffed with mixed physick and managed to kill it. The little ones all covered in fear after that. I got the Demi-Human Queen's Staff... so the big one was their queen, and the Crystal Burst spell she was using.

Deeper in the forest I found another of those candle holders. After touching it, a ghost of a noble starts to walk, leaving glowing footprints on its way. It lead me to the Earthbore Cave. Entering I saw a chest but stepping closer the ground gave away and I fell in a pit full of rats. I managed to get out and found a huge Runebear. Killed it and got the Spelldeake Talisman, which increases protection against magic damage. Back at the beginning I found the chest, but as you could expect there was nothing really valuable in there, just a pickled turtle neck.

I left the forest south and found the Morne Tunnel. It was some kind of mine, full of smithstones and misbegotten. The boss was a Scaly Misbegotten and killing it earned me a Rusty Anchor, a strange choice for a weapon.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Scaly Misbegotten (Morne Tunnel)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/NiFJeh37RKk)

The only thing left for the day was to return to the Tower of Return and finally clear that place. This time I managed to defeat the holy knight and left the teleporter chest alone. I had my revenge, but not much loot. I killed a huge land octopus nearby and called it a day. Tomorrow I'll leave the Weeping Penninsula behind.

#### Day 13

I remembered another Evergaol in Limgrave, on the right side of the bridge to the Weeping Peninsula. I traveled there and it was active, no need for [Stonesword Key](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key)s here. However the prisoner, [Bloodhound Knight Darrivill](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound+Knight+Darriwil) was tough as hell. He was jumping and shadow stepping while slashing with his great sword, inflicting [blood loss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hemorrhage). It was almost impossible to get close enough with the Hookclaws without getting killed. I dodged around like crazy, replenishing health whenever possible, and after several tries, I got lucky and managed to get close to him three times, aggressively dodgeing toward him while he was attacking. My reward: his very own [Bloodhound's Fang](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound's+Fang) greatsword, with blood loss, oh yeah, totally worth it. *(I could have used some help from an NPC summon here, but at the time I wasn't even aware of the existence of Blaidd.)*

[Sir Oakheart vs. Bloodhound Knight Darrivill](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uksb7we9fNI)

There was one more on my map, [Stormhill Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stormhill+Evergaol). The entity in it was a [Crucible Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Knight)... he was tough, I mean very tough. After a few miserable attempts I decided to come back later. *(Or never?)* The reward I would get is a spell that I can live without for now. *(Or forever?... Btw, there is a great [Carbot Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYokDk7dNt4) about this particular boss.)*

While I was around I checked the area southwest of the castle. There was a slumbering [Golem](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Golem), that I managed to kill and a side entrance to the castle gates, where I found the [Arrow's Reach Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow's+Reach+Talisman).

After all this I finally decided to check the [Lakes](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Liurnia+of+the+Lakes). Started out from the [Church of Irith](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Irith) where I met [Thops](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Thops), a sorcerer scholar who was locked out when the Academy magically blocked their gates after the Shattering. He was begging for some runes, so I gave him some. I set out in the water until I found the [map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Liurnia,+East)) of the region. Then I went to shore east and found a waygate among the ruins. 

What could go wrong, I entered and was transported all the way to the end of the road, deep within the region. There was a strange magical door with a blue glowing pattern, but decided not to that way, instead I started to fight some enemies, but wasn't careful and got killed with 11k runes on me and the last grace was way back south. *(I didn't know at the time that a site of grace was just steps away from where they waygate took me.)*

I had to find my way back to the waygate to reach the point of my death, without accidentally being killed. Somehow I managed this and started backtracking on Torrent. On my way I found the [map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Map+(Liurnia,+North)) of this region and about three sites of grace.

Back near the collapsed bridge to Limgrave I fought a troll and found the [Treespear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Treespear) in the back of a carriage, and also met some [four arm enemies](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Marionette+Soldier) who were slashing like crazy at all directions, I left them be for now a.k.a. ran for my life as fast as I could.

I came to know that [Ash of War: Golden Vow](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ash+of+War:+Golden+Vow) is dropped by a [Godrick Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Godrick+Knight) near the [Limgrave Colosseum](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Limgrave+Colosseum). I went there, where I was immediately invaded by [Recusant Henricus](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Recusant+Henricus), but I handled him just fine, and he dropped the [Hammer Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hammer+Talisman). South of the building I found the Knight and defeated him as well while riding Torrent. Done.

I decided to go back to Liurnia again, but now the western side, which was yet to be mapped. I started my journey northwest from the [Church of Irith](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Church+of+Irith). Through the swamp I arrived at the [Village of the Albinaurics](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Village+of+the+Albinaurics), these poor souls, [First-Generation Albinaurics](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/First-Generation+Albinauric) and their village were devestate by cursemongers, or so I hear from [Albus](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Albus), an old guy disguised as a pot. He gave me the right side of the [Haligtree Sacred Medallion](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Haligtree+Secret+Medallion+(Right)) before dying. While exploring this cursed village I met [Nepheli Loux](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nepheli+Loux), who was outraged about the fate of this village, and his father involvement. Further on I ran into an [Omenkiller](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Omenkiller), who I managed to beat and receive the [Crucible Knot Talisman](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crucible+Knot+Talisman). *(I could have summoned Nepheli Loux for this fight, but I didn't see her summon sign.)*

[Sir Oakheart vs. Omenkiller](https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3yaWGfi2oc)

I left the village north and found the [Converted Tower](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Converted+Tower). I had to climb the outer wall and jump across with Torrent to reach the top where I found a [Memory Stone](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Memory+Stone). Further north I arrived at the roots of a [Minor Erdtree](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+(Liurnia+Southwest)), and the [Erdtree Avatar](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Erdtree+Avatar) guarding it. This wasn't so easy as the previous Avatar, but I managed to give Roppy enough time to build up scarlet rot, then I just had to stay away until the creature was dead. My rewards were the [Cerulean Crystal Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cerulean+Crystal+Tear) and the [Raptured Crystal Tear](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Ruptured+Crystal+Tear).

[Sir Oakheart vs. Erdtree Avatar (Liurnia Southwest)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkYpguMwm6g)

I continoued my journey north, and I wanted to take some rest at the [Revenger's Shack](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Revenger's+Shack)... but [Edgar the Revenger](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Edgar+the+Revenger) was home, invading me... who invaded his home, I guess. Well too bad, he fought well, but still fell, dropping his [Banished Knight's Halberd](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Banished+Knight's+Halberd)+8 and some [Raw Meat Dumplings](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Raw+Meat+Dumpling)... he had some laying around in the shack too. This thing is disgusting, restores half of your health, but also inflicts poison. No wonder this can't be crafted.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Edgar the Revenger](https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-XUxNMuKag)

Past the shack I found [Cuckoo's Evergaol](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Cuckoo's+Evergaol) and imprisoned within: [Bols, Carian Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bols,+Carian+Knight). He was a troll with a huge sword and a helmet, casting [Greatblade Phalanx](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Greatblade+Phalanx), sending three magic sword projectiles... well this is a sight. With all my available buffs this fight needed several tries, but I felt I have a chance, so I kept pushing and voilá, my [Hookclaws](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Hookclaws) are still amazing.

[Sir Oakheart vs. Bold, Carian Knight](https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmAtywJeJHs)

I followed the road, fought some agitated [Spirit Jellyfish](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Spirit+Jellyfish) and found a [Jellyfish Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Jellyfish+Shield). Now I'm walking around with a huge translucent blob on my back. From here I didn't stop until [Caria Manor](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caria+Manor). There I was dealt a bunch of hands, who I had to deal with. This place is full of magic, and dangerous enemies, like ghost soldiers and even a [Troll Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll+Knight), like the who I fought in the Evergaol. I might not be strong enough for this place yet. *(At the time I didn't know I was just a few steps away from the boss, but leaving to get stronger was a good decision.)*

#### Day 14

No, I'm definitely not strong enough. Spent some time getiing myself smashed by the Carion Knight giant over and over. I have to figure out something, maybe just leave this place for now. Or... let Roppy tank the giant and run past? I have to think this through.

I decided to check the minor erdteee and its Avatar in northwest Caelid. But first, there was an invader, Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater who I had some business with. Dealing with her was much smoother than I expected so I continued towards the minor erdtree. 

[video]

Well… the avatar proved to be tough. It also uses scarlet rot, and resistant to it (sorry Roppy). I need a decent fire build before I can face this boss again.

So then, let's check the black whetknife in the Siofra River… actually the knife is in the city one level above the river region, and the two are not connected. Great. Anyway while I was there I found a point of interest northeast on the map and tried to reach it, while gathering materials and runes on the way. It was an elevator, locked by a gargoyle statue. It took me… back to Caelid. Great.

No matter, then I should do some exploring here, at least gather the maps. I managed to do that after much running around and avoiding many dangerous foes. But then I found some ruins with kamikaze burning zombies. Killed a bunch of them avoiding the flame thrower chariots, when I found the way underground to a boss arena, with two(!) Mad Pumpkin Head bosses. OMFG! Actually the first try went rather well, I killed one, before the other finished me. This gave me some hope, so I kept trying and managed to beat them. My reward was a Visage Shield, which I can't use yet, but it is nice nevertheless. I decided this was the right time to call it a day.

[video]

#### Day 15

So, I have some loose ends to tie in Limgrave, let's start with the howling at the mist ruins. Kale told me to snap my fingers there. I don't know if it was necessary to kill the runebear, but I did it anyway, it might be sleeping there nice and peaceful, but if I wake it up, it's not nice and definitely not peaceful.

Beilee, the half wolf was waiting for me in a dark corner of the ruins and ask for my help tracking down someone called Darrivill. Oh, I know that guy, back at the Evergaol. I went back just to find Bailee there waiting for me, he said his thanks for my help with a somber smithing stone, which I actually used to upgrade the Bloodfang, it was about time.

I remembered some ruins nearby with a dangerous plant, it was really scary before so I kept my distance, but now felt like giving it a go. On the way from the Evergaol I saw the caravan, omg, two impaled trolls dragging a carriage followed by a dozen nobles, soldiers on foot and horseback. Anothe intimidating sight I was only watching from the distance. Now I decided to see what they are carrying. I have come long way, killing the whole entourage including the trolls only took a few minutes and my reward was a great axe.

Now back to the Waypoint ruins. Finished the plant, it was actually very similar to the boss version I fought before, but I was poisoned and used all my FP here and at the caravan, so when I entered the boss room the Mad Pumpkinhead smashed me to pulp. No matter, had some rest at the nearby grace and gave it another go. Not it melted like butter. 

[video]

And my reward: behind door "only one" there was a lady waiting among glintstone crystals. An academy dropout, who offered her services to teahc me sorcery. Well only if could use any. who knows, maybe at a later time.

Next stop, the Coastal Cave, well, look at that, I found a frail figure crawled up in a knot near the grave. It was Boc, the friendly demi-human, who was turned into a tree. I freed him a few days ago and he was telling me about the bullies in his cave. Now, let's see about that. I cleared the cave, and recovered Boc's sawing needle and a sawing kit. Now he has a purpose and I can alter my Armor, neat.

[video]

There was a tunnel leading outside the boss arena, I took that instead of teleporting back to the beginning and boy it was a good decision. I came out to the on a nearby island with the Church of Dragon something on it. Here I could learn dragon incantations in exchange for dragon hearts... but where could I get one. I remember a dragon in the lake, he is on my list.

I tracked down the dragon, and gave him hell with Roppy and the Hookclaws. I was burned a few times pretty bad, but eventually he fell and I got his heart.

[video]

Just a little north from where the dragon fell was a tunnel entrance. I was in a similar tunnel before on the Weeping Penninsula, lots of upgrade materials inside, and and boss, a Stonedigger Troll in this case. Beating it rewarded me with the Roar Talisman.

[video]

I travelled further north and cleared a cemetery below Stormhill, while this wasn't the place I was looking for I found Godrick Soldier ashes. I actually took the wrong turn looking for Groveside cave which was just north of the Church of Elijah. In the cave I beat the Beastman of Farum Azula to earn the Flamedrake talisman. This would have been useful fighting the dragon before, innit?

Back on the beach near the coastal cave I encountered an invisible thing that was rolling around in a pattern leaving golden marks on the ground. I saw a similar thing in Caelid, but now I managed to kill it. It was a "dung beetle" and dropped an ash of war. Now I knew I had to track down a beetle in Caelid, maybe it was the same? I found the invisible beetle and managed to kill it, but it wasn't the ash I was looking for. So I kept searching further.

In the middle of the rotting lake I was invaded. Managed to kill the invader, but lost a bunch of runes, and at the moment of my victory some big ass soldiers appeared to finishe me off... This place is hell.

Never mind. I stood up and found the beetle and applied the Lifesteal Fists on my hookclaws. Oh yeah. I found a misty cave entrance nearby, decided to open it. It was the Gaol Cave, imprisoned within a bunch of those kamikaze zombies, wardens and at the end a Frenzied Duelist. I beat him on the second try and leaving his room through a tunnel I was greeted with the calming view of Limgrave... such a relief. And just in front of me and a new sword.

[video]

I was tired, had to go back to Roundtable Hold and maybe tell people about my adventures. Hmm... somethings not right. It's dark here. From my left an invader came into view and sliced me up. What is happening!? Next time I was prepared. Finishing him gave me some nasty fist weapons and turned the place back to its original state, but hey, the grumpy guy outside grandpa's room is gone, and his Armor laying around. So you were the one, I never trusted you. 

[video]

I felt restless, so I decided to take a look at the eastern side of Liurnia. I hate the soldiers with four hands, they shoot arrows like crazy and when you get close it feels like in a blender. Damn.
There are also a lot of wolves around here. And they are tougher. While I was escaping a pack I stumbled upon a Tibia Mariner, the death creature with the boat. I liked this fight in Limgrave before so I decided to give it a try. It want well and I got skeletal bandit ashes too. Nice ending of a long day. Time to rest.

[video]

#### Day 16

I stayed around the eastern part of Liurnia. Found a statue that was leading me to Cliffbttom Catacombs. So far this was the most difficult dungeon I attempted. First, the obvious way does not lead to the lever. Oh no, it leads to traps, imps and onens guarding a few materials and a scythe, which is not that bad to be fair, but then where is the lever.

Turné out one has to jump down below, where one of the omens stand guard. If you do it right, you fall into the bushes and crouch immediately, then it might not notice you. The other one is patrolling the circular corridor. There are bushes everywhere so you can stealth around. Leaving through the only exit leads to a room with another big guy, with a big ass sword. I'm sure there is a clever way to kill it, but I didn't have much patience at this point so I tried to rush past it. Finally a ladder, I climbed and there was the lever, but that thing also climbed up, what the hell. Pulled the lever, quickly grabbed some item on the right and jumped down to the ramp. The thing did too, it was following me, so I ran, all the way to the elevator.

Finally the boss arena was open, so after some rest I went straight there. It was a watchdog, of course, but this one wielded a staff and used glintstone magic. No surprise so close to Raya Lazarus. Took me two attempts, I melted it's HP while Roppy tanked, was rewarded with the Kaiden Sellsword Ashes.

While rushing in the lever area I missed one item, I have to come back for.

[video]

From here I travelled west through the lake. After killing some creepy hunchback enemies I found a girl, agreed to find her stolen necklace and also Patches, so set up shop here. I sat beside him by the campfire and thought about how difficult this day was.

#### Day 17

I left Patches' little camp south to check Laskyar Ruins. On the way I had some trouble with Demi-humans and wraith callers, but nothing much. When I reached the ruins there was a teleporter in the middle. Stepping close Wraith Callers started to appear and suddenly a Revenant. They quickly tore me apart. I tried a couple times to kill it but it was just too aggressive, so I decided to go somewhere else.

Found a candle holder nearby and followed the spirit to the Lakeside Crystal Cave. Inside I had to fight Demi-humans and crystal snails while jumping lower and lower. At the bottom a Bloodhound Knight was waiting for me. I had to give this fight several tries and the most annoying about it was that I had to fight through most of the cave to get there. I used this right as an opportunity to practice guard counter with the Bloodhound's Fang. Ironic that I killed him with his own weapon. I got the Cerulean Amber Medallion.

[video]

I left the cave through a tunnel that lead me to the Slumbering Wolf Shack, where I met Latenna. She was the albinuaric who Albus asked me to find. She asked for some help in exchange for the other half of the medallion.

With a clearer head I tried again to beat the Revenant. And after a few tries Insucceeded. Looted a smithing stone and some other stuff, but the most interesting item was underground's wraith caller's bell.

[video]

Now that there were no more enemies I used the portal that placed me in front of the Raya Lucaria Academy gates. The same place I ended up few days ago. this time I noticed the grace further toward the gate, and also found a map with a meeting place marked. I decided to visit the place but the only thing I found there was a sleeping dragon...

#### Day 18

I've killed dragons... well, one dragon. So I can do this. This dragon, Smarag was similar to the previous one, but instead of fire, it used glintstone magic, and besides the breath attack, also fired a large projectile. I could bring down half of its health, but I usually fall of Torrent and that's death. I retreated for now and started some research.

Smarag is most vulnerable to piercing attacks and I happen to have a +8 Halberd. Also Roppy is not the best spirit to aid me here... Banished Knight Oleg. Which is dropped by the Ulcerated Tree Spirit in Fringefolk Hero's Grave. This is it. I can't delay this further. I have to go back and face the damn tree snake... and the chariot.

Well How about, no. Actually I don't have enough FP to summon Oleg or Einhall or... wait a minute, Latenna, the Albinauric woman, with the wolf. I can summon her, and someone said she is very good against dragons. Let's see.

So, I accidentally summoned Latenna at a random spot, but no worries, I'll fail better this time. The Halberd doesn't work, I move too fast with Torrent to land good hits. Couple rounds around the rock and I was nocked off the saddle, right in the middle of glintstone fire. You're dead.

Ok, this time I set up Latenna up on a smaller rock, so she has a clean shot on Smarag and probably safe from fire. I switched back to good old Hookclaws, prepared some raisins for Torrent and jumped into action. And it was great, an awesome dragon fight again, and success, another dragon heart. The keys I came for I actually looted during one of the previous tries, but no matter, killing the dragon was the real reward here. Yeah.

[video]

So, full off ambition I trotted in the middle of Temple Quarter and hit the lonely guy in the middle... suddenly a whole village was cartwheeling toward me, and I'm dead. What the hell!? Next time I carefully removed every hiding enemy around the middle one, still on attack three small ones emerged from the water, but still it was much easier. Also I'm using the Demi-human group now, these boys are tough and aggressive. I like them.

After killing everyone I looted a Frost Hatchet from a chest, and called it a day.
