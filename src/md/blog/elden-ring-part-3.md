  Disclaimer: Spoilers ahead! This is a blog about my first playthrough of Elden Ring. It's a collection of events that are getting more and more detailed over time as I get better at telling my character's story. The videos are captures of important events, mostly successful boss fights. This is not intended to be a guide and contains no detailed builds or stats.

#### Day 14

No, I'm definitely not strong enough. I spent some time getting myself smashed by the [Troll Knight](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Troll+Knight) over and over. I have to figure something out. Maybe I should leave this place for now. Or... let Roppy tank the giant and run past? I have to think this through.

I left to check the [Minor Erdteee](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Minor+Erdtree+(Caelid)) and its [Putrid Avatar](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Avatar) in northwest [Caelid](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelid). But first, I had some business with an invader, [Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Anastasia+Tarnished-Eater) near the [Smoldering Church](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Smoldering+Church). Dealing with her was much smoother than I expected, I got the [Sacred Scorpion Charm](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Scorpion+Charm) and continued towards my original goal.

Well, this avatar proved to be tough. It also inflicts [scarlet rot](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scarlet+Rot) and is resistant to it (there goes my strategy, sorry, Roppy), but all Erdtee Avatars are vulnerable to fire. So, I need to be able to do decent fire damage before I can face this boss again. Great.

Let's check something else on my wishlist: the [Black Whetblade](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Black+Whetblade) in the [Siofra River](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Siofra+River) region... After wandering around for a while, I realized that the knife is actually in [Nokron, Eternal City](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Nokron,+Eternal+City), one level above the river, and the two are not directly connected. Great, again.

Anyway, while I was down there looking for a way into Nokron, I found a point of interest northeast on the map and tried to reach it while gathering runes and materials and lighting strange statues on the way. It was another elevator, the [Deep Siofra Well](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Deep+Siofra+Well), locked by a gargoyle statue. It took me back to *(drumroll)* Caelid. Great, mother of Godwyn.

Ok, something told me I should stay here and explore, at least gather the maps. I managed to do that after much running around and avoiding dangerous foes. Then I found some [ruins](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Caelem+Ruins) with [burning kamikaze zombies](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Putrid+Corpse). I killed a bunch of them, avoiding the [Flame Chariots](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Flame+Chariot), when I found the way underground to a boss arena, with a [Mad Pumpkin Head](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Mad+Pumpkin+Head) Duo(!). OMFG! Actually, the first try went rather well. I killed one before the other finished me. This gave me some hope, so I kept trying and managed to beat them. My reward was a [Visage Shield](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Visage+Shield), which I can't use yet, but it is nice nevertheless.

I decided this was the right time to call it a day.

#### Day 15

So, I had some loose ends to tie in Limgrave, let's start with the howling at the mist ruins. Kale told me to snap my fingers there. I don't know if it was necessary to kill the runebear, but I did it anyway, it might have been sleeping there nice and peaceful, but if I wake it up, it's not nice and definitely not peaceful.

Blaidd, the half wolf was waiting for me in a dark corner of the ruins and asked for my help tracking down someone called Darrivill. Oh, I know that guy, back at the Evergaol. I went back just to find Blaidd there waiting for me, he said his thanks for my help with a somber smithing stone, which I actually used to upgrade the Bloodhound's Fang, it was about time.

I remembered some ruins nearby with a dangerous plant, it was really scary before so I kept my distance, but now felt like giving it a go. On the way from the Evergaol I saw the caravan, omg, two impaled trolls dragging a carriage followed by a dozen nobles, soldiers on foot and horseback. Anothe intimidating sight I was only watching from the distance. Now I decided to see what they are carrying. I have come long way, killing the whole entourage including the trolls only took a few minutes and my reward was a great axe.

Now back to the Waypoint ruins. Finished the plant, it was actually very similar to the boss version I fought before, but I was poisoned and used all my FP here and at the caravan, so when I entered the boss room the Mad Pumpkinhead smashed me to pulp. No matter, had some rest at the nearby grace and gave it another go. Not it melted like butter.

And my reward: behind door "only one" there was a lady waiting among glintstone crystals. An academy dropout, who offered her services to teahc me sorcery. Well only if could use any. who knows, maybe at a later time.

Next stop, the Coastal Cave, well, look at that, I found a frail figure crawled up in a knot near the grave. It was Boc, the friendly demi-human, who was turned into a tree. I freed him a few days ago and he was telling me about the bullies in his cave. Now, let's see about that. I cleared the cave, and recovered Boc's sawing needle and a sawing kit. Now he has a purpose and I can alter my Armor, neat.

[video]

There was a tunnel leading outside the boss arena, I took that instead of teleporting back to the beginning and boy it was a good decision. I came out to the on a nearby island with the Church of Dragon something on it. Here I could learn dragon incantations in exchange for dragon hearts... but where could I get one. I remember a dragon in the lake, he is on my list.

I tracked down the dragon, and gave him hell with Roppy and the Hookclaws. I was burned a few times pretty bad, but eventually he fell and I got his heart.

[video]

Just a little north from where the dragon fell was a tunnel entrance. I was in a similar tunnel before on the Weeping Penninsula, lots of upgrade materials inside, and and boss, a Stonedigger Troll in this case. Beating it rewarded me with the Roar Talisman.

[video]

I travelled further north and cleared a cemetery below Stormhill, while this wasn't the place I was looking for I found Godrick Soldier ashes. I actually took the wrong turn looking for Groveside cave which was just north of the Church of Elijah. In the cave I beat the Beastman of Farum Azula to earn the Flamedrake talisman. This would have been useful fighting the dragon before, innit?

Back on the beach near the coastal cave I encountered an invisible thing that was rolling around in a pattern leaving golden marks on the ground. I saw a similar thing in Caelid, but now I managed to kill it. It was a "dung beetle" and dropped an ash of war. Now I knew I had to track down a beetle in Caelid, maybe it was the same? I found the invisible beetle and managed to kill it, but it wasn't the ash I was looking for. So I kept searching further.

In the middle of the rotting lake I was invaded. Managed to kill the invader, but lost a bunch of runes, and at the moment of my victory some big ass soldiers appeared to finishe me off... This place is hell.

Never mind. I stood up and found the beetle and applied the Lifesteal Fists on my hookclaws. Oh yeah. I found a misty cave entrance nearby, decided to open it. It was the Gaol Cave, imprisoned within a bunch of those kamikaze zombies, wardens and at the end a Frenzied Duelist. I beat him on the second try and leaving his room through a tunnel I was greeted with the calming view of Limgrave... such a relief. And just in front of me and a new sword.

[video]

I was tired, had to go back to Roundtable Hold and maybe tell people about my adventures. Hmm... somethings not right. It's dark here. From my left an invader came into view and sliced me up. What is happening!? Next time I was prepared. Finishing him gave me some nasty fist weapons and turned the place back to its original state, but hey, the grumpy guy outside grandpa's room is gone, and his Armor laying around. So you were the one, I never trusted you. 

[video]

I felt restless, so I decided to take a look at the eastern side of Liurnia. I hate the soldiers with four hands, they shoot arrows like crazy and when you get close it feels like in a blender. Damn.

There are also a lot of wolves around here. And they are tougher. While I was escaping a pack I stumbled upon a Tibia Mariner, the death creature with the boat. I liked this fight in Limgrave before so I decided to give it a try. It want well and I got skeletal bandit ashes too. Nice ending of a long day. Time to rest.

#### Day 16

I stayed around the eastern part of Liurnia. Found a statue that was leading me to Cliffbttom Catacombs. So far this was the most difficult dungeon I attempted. First, the obvious way does not lead to the lever. Oh no, it leads to traps, imps and onens guarding a few materials and a scythe, which is not that bad to be fair, but then where is the lever.

Turné out one has to jump down below, where one of the omens stand guard. If you do it right, you fall into the bushes and crouch immediately, then it might not notice you. The other one is patrolling the circular corridor. There are bushes everywhere so you can stealth around. Leaving through the only exit leads to a room with another big guy, with a big ass sword. I'm sure there is a clever way to kill it, but I didn't have much patience at this point so I tried to rush past it. Finally a ladder, I climbed and there was the lever, but that thing also climbed up, what the hell. Pulled the lever, quickly grabbed some item on the right and jumped down to the ramp. The thing did too, it was following me, so I ran, all the way to the elevator.

Finally the boss arena was open, so after some rest I went straight there. It was a watchdog, of course, but this one wielded a staff and used glintstone magic. No surprise so close to Raya Lazarus. Took me two attempts, I melted it's HP while Roppy tanked, was rewarded with the Kaiden Sellsword Ashes.

While rushing in the lever area I missed one item, I have to come back for.

[video]

From here I travelled west through the lake. After killing some creepy hunchback enemies I found a girl, agreed to find her stolen necklace and also Patches, so set up shop here. I sat beside him by the campfire and thought about how difficult this day was.

#### Day 17

I left Patches' little camp south to check Laskyar Ruins. On the way I had some trouble with Demi-humans and wraith callers, but nothing much. When I reached the ruins there was a teleporter in the middle. Stepping close Wraith Callers started to appear and suddenly a Revenant. They quickly tore me apart. I tried a couple times to kill it but it was just too aggressive, so I decided to go somewhere else.

Found a candle holder nearby and followed the spirit to the Lakeside Crystal Cave. Inside I had to fight Demi-humans and crystal snails while jumping lower and lower. At the bottom a Bloodhound Knight was waiting for me. I had to give this fight several tries and the most annoying about it was that I had to fight through most of the cave to get there. I used this right as an opportunity to practice guard counter with the Bloodhound's Fang. Ironic that I killed him with his own weapon. I got the Cerulean Amber Medallion.

[video]

I left the cave through a tunnel that lead me to the Slumbering Wolf Shack, where I met Latenna. She was the albinuaric who Albus asked me to find. She asked for some help in exchange for the other half of the medallion.

With a clearer head I tried again to beat the Revenant. And after a few tries Insucceeded. Looted a smithing stone and some other stuff, but the most interesting item was underground's wraith caller's bell.

[video]

Now that there were no more enemies I used the portal that placed me in front of the Raya Lucaria Academy gates. The same place I ended up few days ago. this time I noticed the grace further toward the gate, and also found a map with a meeting place marked. I decided to visit the place but the only thing I found there was a sleeping dragon...

#### Day 18

I've killed dragons... well, one dragon. So I can do this. This dragon, Smarag was similar to the previous one, but instead of fire, it used glintstone magic, and besides the breath attack, also fired a large projectile. I could bring down half of its health, but I usually fall of Torrent and that's death. I retreated for now and started some research.

Smarag is most vulnerable to piercing attacks and I happen to have a +8 Halberd. Also Roppy is not the best spirit to aid me here... Banished Knight Oleg. Which is dropped by the Ulcerated Tree Spirit in Fringefolk Hero's Grave. This is it. I can't delay this further. I have to go back and face the damn tree snake... and the chariot.

Well How about, no. Actually I don't have enough FP to summon Oleg or Einhall or... wait a minute, Latenna, the Albinauric woman, with the wolf. I can summon her, and someone said she is very good against dragons. Let's see.

So, I accidentally summoned Latenna at a random spot, but no worries, I'll fail better this time. The Halberd doesn't work, I move too fast with Torrent to land good hits. Couple rounds around the rock and I was nocked off the saddle, right in the middle of glintstone fire. You're dead.

Ok, this time I set up Latenna up on a smaller rock, so she has a clean shot on Smarag and probably safe from fire. I switched back to good old Hookclaws, prepared some raisins for Torrent and jumped into action. And it was great, an awesome dragon fight again, and success, another dragon heart. The keys I came for I actually looted during one of the previous tries, but no matter, killing the dragon was the real reward here. Yeah.

[video]

So, full off ambition I trotted in the middle of Temple Quarter and hit the lonely guy in the middle... suddenly a whole village was cartwheeling toward me, and I'm dead. What the hell!? Next time I carefully removed every hiding enemy around the middle one, still on attack three small ones emerged from the water, but still it was much easier. Also I'm using the Demi-human group now, these boys are tough and aggressive. I like them.

After killing everyone I looted a Frost Hatchet from a chest, and called it a day.
